                <h1>I Build Tools to Make Life Easier</h1>
                <p>
                    My passion is creating tools that are genuinely useful. Sometimes that's 
                    a suite of software the requires a team of professionals to build out, and 
                    sometimes it's a set of instructions knocked out by a single person in an
                    afternoon.

            <h2>User Experience</h2>
            <p>My areas of focus in UX are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Optimizing workflow and business rules, including discovery of
                    users' existing processes and expectations
                </li>
                <li>Identifying and incorporating users' mental models, including
                    direct user research and usability testing
                </li>
                <li>Creating fast mockups and prototypes to bring teams into alignment</li>
                <li>Defining a clear design language and building tools to help
                    developers easily implement it
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                TL;DR : I care about making it work, not about making it pretty.

                <p>
                    I worked for several years as a professional technical writer,

                    and my co-workers.

                <p>
                    While that's no longer on my list of job duties, it is still something
                    I believe in. I continue to produce:

                    Y'all, I just love creating tools, no matter what materials
                    are laying around.
